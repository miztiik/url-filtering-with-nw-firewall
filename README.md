# Firewall for Url filtering

Mystique Unicorn App is looking to deploy a firewall that should _allow_ or _drop_ traffic based on customizable rules. The team is looking for your help to achieve this. Can you help them?

## üéØ Solutions

Up until very recently, network prevention has been quite limited,
- Create _Security Groups_ to limit various types of _layer 3 and 4 traffic_ 
- _or_ Create _Network Access Control Lists (NACL)_ to limit _layer 3 and 4 traffic_
- _or_ Route traffic through a custom network appliance running as an EC2 instance 

This is not enough in many use-cases, You also want the ability to take action based on the payload. The recently launched AWS Network Firewall<sup>[1]<sup> provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop traffic to known bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names. At launch you have the following capabilities.
- _Allow_ or _Deny_ based on source IP and/or port, destination IP and/or port, and protocol (also known as 5-tuple)
- _Allow_ or _Deny_ based upon domain names
- _Allow_ or _Deny_ based upon Suricata-compatible IPS rules

In this demo, We will build a architecture, similar to the one shown above. We will start backwards so that all the dependencies are satisfied.

1.  ## üß∞ Prerequisites

    This demo, instructions, scripts and cloudformation template is designed to be run in `us-east-1`. With few modifications you can try it out in other regions as well(_Not covered here_).

    - üõ† AWS CLI Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://youtu.be/TPyyfmQte0U)
    - üõ† AWS CDK Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwxpszw0Rc)
    - üõ† Python Packages, _Change the below commands to suit your OS, the following is written for amzn linux 2_
      - Python3 - `yum install -y python3`
      - Python Pip - `yum install -y python-pip`
      - Virtualenv - `pip3 install virtualenv`

1.  ## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up the environment

    - Get the application code

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/miztiik/url-filtering-with-nw-firewall
      cd url-filtering-with-nw-firewall
      ```

1.  ## üöÄ Prepare the dev environment to run AWS CDK

    We will use `cdk` to make our deployments easier. Lets go ahead and install the necessary components.

    ```bash
    # You should have npm pre-installed
    # If you DONT have cdk installed
    npm install -g aws-cdk

    # Make sure you in root directory
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The very first time you deploy an AWS CDK app into an environment _(account/region)_, you‚Äôll need to install a `bootstrap stack`, Otherwise just go ahead and deploy using `cdk deploy`.

    ```bash
    cdk bootstrap
    cdk ls
    # Follow on screen prompts
    ```

    You should see an output of the available stacks,

    ```bash
    url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-vpc-stack
    url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-stack
    secured-workload-on-ec2-stack
    ```

1.  ## üöÄ Deploying the application

    Let us walk through each of the stacks,

    - **Stack: url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-vpc-stack**

      This stack will create an custom VPC to host our firewall and test workload.

      Initiate the deployment with the following command,

      ```bash
      cdk deploy url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-vpc-stack
      ```

    - **Stack: url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-stack**

      This stack will the network firewall in the _firewall subnet_. We will do create _stateful_ rules as they offer better control. We will forward all _stateless_ traffic to through the _stateful_ rules. This way all traffic flow through our rule set.

      This stack will create `3` rules,
        - `ALLOW-For-Domains` - This rule will allows traffic only to these two domains`"aws.com", "google.com"` from the workloads in the VPC.
        - `DENY-For-Domains` - This rule will denies traffic to these two domains`".example.com",".modi-am-i.com"` from the workloads in the VPC.
        - `DENY-On-Url` - Any traffic to with text `deny_test` in the url will be denied. 
          **NOTE:** - This rule is not attached to the firewall, we will later add this during our testing phase.

      Initiate the deployment with the following command,

      ```bash
      cdk deploy url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-stack
      ```

      After successfully deploying the stack, Check the `Outputs` section of the stack. You will find the `NetworkFirewallEndpoints` that does traffic routing between subnets.

    - **Stack: secured-workload-on-ec2-stack**

      This stack deploys a simple EC2 instance that also runs a webserver with two webpages - One for `/` page and `deny_test` page. You can also login to the instance using SSM Session Manager<sup>[2]<sup>.

      Initiate the deployment with the following command,

      ```bash
      cdk deploy secured-workload-on-ec2-stack
      ```

      After successfully deploying the stack, Check the `Outputs` section of the stack. You will find the `PublicWorkloadInstance` instance id and the `WebServerUrl`.


1.  ## üî¨ Testing the solution

    - Use the `WebServerUrl` from the previous stack on your browser. You should be able to access the `/` page and also the `deny_test` page. Make sure to use `http` and not `https` as the webserver is not configured with any certificates. For example `http://34.232.95.57` and `http://34.232.95.57/deny_test`

    ![Miztiik Automation: AWS Network Firewall for Url filtering](images/miztiik_automation_url_filtering_with_nw_firewall_architecture_003.png)

    - Now login to the EC2 instance using SSM Session Manager<sup>[2]<sup>
    - Try to access the allowed and denied domains

    ```sh
    curl aws.com
    curl google.com
    curl example.com
    ```

    ![Miztiik Automation: AWS Network Firewall for Url filtering](images/miztiik_automation_url_filtering_with_nw_firewall_architecture_002.png)

    You will notice that the first two requests were successful, whereas the last two were blocked by the firewall. Now let try to add the `DENY-On-Url` to our firewall.

    - Goto VPC Service > Network Firewalls > `url-filtering-with-nw-firewall-stack`
    - Under Stateful rule groups > Add rule groups > Add stateful rule groups to the firewall policy
    - Select `DENY-On-Url` > Add stateful rule group
  
    Now try to access the `deny_test` page in your browser, preferably in private mode to avoid fetching locally cached page, Your request should time out

    ![Miztiik Automation: AWS Network Firewall for Url filtering](images/miztiik_automation_url_filtering_with_nw_firewall_architecture_004.png)

    Now lets check our logs to see why our traffic was blocked. 
    ![Miztiik Automation: AWS Network Firewall for Url filtering](images/miztiik_automation_url_filtering_with_nw_firewall_architecture_005.png)
    You can notice that the request does matches our deny FQDN rule and the traffic was _blocked_.

    If you poke around the logs, you will also find the logs for _deny_test_ url. This request has the custom error message that we added in the deny rule -  `Miztiik drop tcp traffic`

1.  ## üìí Conclusion

      Here we have demonstrated how to use network firewall to _allow_ of _deny_ request based on the domain names. The firewall also gives us the ability to deny request to unsecure urls as well.
1.  ## üßπ CleanUp

    If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

    - Resources created during [Deploying The Application](#-deploying-the-application)
    - Delete CloudWatch Lambda LogGroups
    - _Any other custom resources, you have created for this demo_

    ```bash
    # Delete from cdk
    cdk destroy

    # Follow any on-screen prompts

    # Delete the CF Stack, If you used cloudformation to deploy the stack.
    aws cloudformation delete-stack \
      --stack-name "MiztiikAutomationStack" \
      --region "${AWS_REGION}"
    ```

    This is not an exhaustive list, please carry out other necessary steps as maybe applicable to your needs.
